          It does what? No one knew that 2,000 years ago, the technology
          existed to build such a device. The Antikythera mechanism, 
          pictured, is now widely regarded as the first computer. 
          Found at the bottom of the sea aboard a decaying Greek ship, 
          its complexity prompted decades of study, and even today some 
          of its functions likely remain unknown. X-ray images of the 
          device, however, have confirmed that a main function of its 
          numerous clock-like wheels and gears is to create a portable, 
          hand-cranked, Earth-centered, orrery of the sky, predicting 
          future star and planet locations as well as lunar and solar 
          eclipses. The corroded core of the Antikythera mechanism's 
          largest gear is featured, spanning about 13 centimeters, while 
          the entire mechanism was 33 centimeters high, making it similar 
          in size to a large book. Recently, modern computer modeling of 
          missing components is allowing for the creation of a more complete 
          replica of this surprising ancient machine.
